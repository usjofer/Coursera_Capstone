# Battle of Neighborhood:Coffee, Subway and Sushi

Let's assume we are about to move to New York City. We've found 3 apartments at approximately same price at the following addresses:
- 49 First Ave, New York, NY 10003 
- 22 Cornelia St, New York, NY 10014
- 167 Hester St, New York, NY 10013
<br><br>
**The task is to decide which address is the most favourable to live in according to these criteria:**
- proximity to subway stations
- proximity to coffe shops 
- proximity to sushi restaurants (can't live a week without a Californa roll!)
The proximity factor is also defined as 500 meters (~1/3 mile).
<br><br>Using FourSquare data, we will identify the points of interest in the vincinity of each address, plot them on a map Folio and draw the conclusion
#### Scoring method:

|Point of Interest|Points|
|-----------|------|
|Subway stop|5     | 
|Coffee shop|3     | 
|Sushi Rest |2     |
